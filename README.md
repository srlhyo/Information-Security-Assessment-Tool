# Information-Security-Assessment-Tool

**Version 1.0.0**

ISAT is a web application tool that evaluates the level of preparedness and resilience existent within an organisation, followed by well-formed recommendations to  mitigate data breaches and cyber attacks.

ISAT follows a traffic light model with three possible results: Green, Amber and Red. Green means that the organisation is well equipped to mitigate data breaches and cyber attacks. Amber means there is a heightened risk of data breaches and attacks. Whereas Red means that there are no cyber security preventative measures in place. Critically, the organisation is non-compliant with the law and regulatory requirements.

## How ISAT works

No registration is required. The User fill in a brief questionnaire created to ascertain the level of preparedness and resilience of their organisation. The three possible results are Green, Amber and Red. Following the result, the user is advised accordingly. 

If there is any security issue, the User is given the option to sign-in for a service to address the issue/(s) indentified. 

If there are no issues, the User can sign-in to our Newsletter, or just leave the web application.
